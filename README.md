# Predicting-heart-disease-using-machine-learning
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.


1. Problem Definition
In a statement,

Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

2. Data
The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset
